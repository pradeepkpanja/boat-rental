## Problem at my work place found a solution

# I am working at Harbourfront Center Sailiing and powerboating as a customer service representative. Here is where I came up with a problem while reserving tickets for the customers. 

It takes a lot of time to create an invoice as the system is too costly for the company so I made a website using MERN stack so that it is easy to create an invoice in just one click.

There will be many changes coming in the future to this project. Stay tuned!
